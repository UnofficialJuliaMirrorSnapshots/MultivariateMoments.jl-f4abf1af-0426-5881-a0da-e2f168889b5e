# MultivariateMoments --- Multivariate Moments for Julia

Extension of [MultivariatePolynomials](https://github.com/JuliaAlgebra/MultivariatePolynomials.jl) to moments of multivariate measures and their scalar product with polynomials.
It also includes the extraction of atomic measures from moment matrices which is related to the [moment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_problem).
